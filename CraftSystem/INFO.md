This project is going to be a unique one that mimics the minecraft crafting system where a user is given a set of items, initially, with which he can craft his items with.
This project is limited to only the crafting mechanics and inventory mechanics and can't go further than that, even though it could. This is by far a complex but satisfying project I've made.
