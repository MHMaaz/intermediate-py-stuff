# intermediate-py-stuff
This repo contains those projects that are complex and on an intermediate level. These take time but I enjoy making them.
Side note: All of the projects in this repo are projects with which im learning a programming language. These projects can be unique and can be simple. Most of them are only limited to the VS code output window from which input can be given and output can be recieved. These projects are fully constructed by me and rarely some help on how a certain command or function works.
